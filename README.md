- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning golang and networking with eBPF.
- âš¡ I'm helping to do code review, answer questions, discuss ideas in @golangci-lint [project](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Agolangci%2Fgolangci-lint+author%3Asayboras+).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on @cilium project, where I learn from other members and community daily, and in turn I contribute back with some [bug fixes and features](https://github.com/pulls?q=org%3Acilium+author%3Asayboras+).
- :sparkles: I used to be quite active in [eksctl](https://github.com/pulls?q=repo%3Aweaveworks%2Feksctl+author%3Asayboras+). Some of issues you are facing might be introduced by me :disappointed:.
